## Introduction

Welcome to our Crowdfunding Platform project! This repository contains the frontend and smart contract code for our secure Crowdfunding platform developed as part of a university project. The platform leverages blockchain technology, machine learning, and secure development practices to provide a secure and transparent crowdfunding experience.

## Features

- **Secure Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts written in Solidity for secure and transparent crowdfunding transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend developed using React and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Integration with Web3.js and MetaMask for secure blockchain transactions.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilization of machine learning algorithms for fraud detection and security enhancement.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Adherence to secure coding standards and best practices to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally, navigate to the `client` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
````

To deploy the smart contract, navigate to the `web3` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run deploy
```


Make sure to set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the `web3` directory and adding your private key as follows:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```
